Hi @everyone,

One of our server partners, Studious Students, had an unfortunate incident where their server was hacked and deleted. WSC would like to extend our dearest condolences, and wishes a speedy recovery for Studious Students.

The invite for the new server will be up in #server-partners once the new Studious Students server is fully completed. For now, if there are any questions, comments, or concerns from the community, feel free to discuss them in #lounge or #cafe :)

We look forward to a continued partnership between our servers!


Best Regards,   
Sakura ðŸŒ¸, on behalf of WSC Staff
