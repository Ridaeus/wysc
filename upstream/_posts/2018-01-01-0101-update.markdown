**@everyone  \| UPDATE 2018.01.01**   
\-\-\-

It's a new year, and we've recruited a new member to our Staff team: @Trevish!

Formerly a Server Partner, Trevish has now joined WSC as our new Marketing Director. With his seasoned background in the educational social media sector working on a studygram and Discord study server, Trevish would be a perfect fit for WSC! We happily look forward to working with him on creating a improving and expanding WSC as we seek to continue our growth :)

Thank you from WSC, and have a wonderful 2018! ðŸŽ‰
