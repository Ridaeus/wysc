### Wysc on Discord

Wysc's server design, channel/category organization, and unique channel features are **open for others to replicate, as long as there is substantial remixing of features.**

We are always happy to see other servers incorporating our ideas! For example, we have pioneered a cafe experience through channels such as #studygram, automated mixed-use content feeds, and liberal use of colored embeds. All these features are available for the public to use as well! We encourage users to [check out our Credits page](/docs/credits) to see how we do it and create their own server using the very tools that have helped make our server possible.

However, **we do not tolerate a significantly replicated user experience** without prior arrangements or proper attribution. This includes (but is not limited to) copying many or all aspects of our server without a different target audience, using phrasing that is similar to our promotional material without noticeable variation, or providing an experience that may cause confusion between Wysc and your creation. Not only does this violate Wysc licenses, but depending on implementations, may also infringe on the licenses of content we use.
