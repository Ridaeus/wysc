To help streamline the Wysc experience, we've renamed some bots to "Cafe Bot".

**All "Cafe Bots" use the `,` prefix.**

⚠️ *Bots may collect information about your user account, usage data, and all messages you send. Wysc cannot control this. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and [Credits page](/docs/credits#discord-server) for more info.*
