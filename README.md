### Credits:

We do not believe in theft of other works. Using our open source code to contribute to your own works is okay, but wholesale theft for personal profit crosses a line at Wysc.

Are we missing something? [Let us know and we'll be glad to add you on our list!](https://wysc.us.to/contact#official-inquiries)
