While Wysc is open source, our intentions are for users to use our assets to inspire your own creations. Any work created using the resources on Wysc Github that may cause confusion for users between your product and Wysc's, and does not properly attribute, will be considered a breach of copyright.


### Wysc on Discord

Wysc's server design, channel/category organization, and unique channel features are **open for others to replicate, as long as there is substantial remixing of features.**

We are always happy to see other servers incorporating our ideas! For example, we have pioneered a cafe experience through channels such as #studygram, automated mixed-use content feeds, and liberal use of colored embeds. But all these features are available for the public to use as well! We encourage users to [check out our Credits page](credits) to see how we do it and create their own server using the very tools that have helped make our server possible.

However, **we do not tolerate a significantly replicated user experience** without prior arrangements. This includes (but is not limited to) copying many or all aspects of our server without a different target audience, using phrasing that is similar to our promotional material without noticeable variation, or providing an experience that may cause confusion between Wysc and your creation.

**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us on our Contact page](../org/contact) or send us a message in #support to make it happen.

**If you have an idea to improve Wysc**, come join us in Contributor Hub! [See Contributor Hub for more details.](../../dev)
