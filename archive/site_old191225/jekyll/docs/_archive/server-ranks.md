## How Wysc Works

To check your current Server XP, simply type `,rank`.

Wysc's activity-based ranking system has been designed to maximize user freedom and flexibility within the server based on legacy and activity level. By restricting permissions to those who are more active, short-term users are (1) incentivized to participate in Wysc's community, and (2) deters malicious users from obtaining increased permissions without expending effort. However, this also allows us to meet our commitment to be an open platform for hosting conversations and providing a comfortable atmosphere for those who wish to become a part of our community.
