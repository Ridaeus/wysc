### Brand Guidelines

Wysc believes in transparency of how we operate and to provide an open experience for our community members. However, Wysc takes intellectual property seriously.

**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us](/docs/contact) to make it happen.

**If you have an idea to improve Wysc**, come join us in Contributor Hub! [See Contributor Hub for more details.](/docs/dev)

### Terms of Service

Wysc operates spaces for other users to enjoy. While we strive to present a friendly environment, the spaces themselves may present hazards. You should know about them.
