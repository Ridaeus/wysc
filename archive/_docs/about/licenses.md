### In Regards to Third Party Content


If you would like to create an experience similar to Wysc but tailored to a different audience, [reach out to us](/docs/about/contact) and we can start a partnership!

**All third party content in Wysc are subject to the creator's respective licenses, including partnered content.** Due to Wysc's approaches, including but not limited to the use of partnered content, implementation of code, and setup of infrastructure, it is currently against license agreements for others to make an exact duplicate of Wysc as-is. This means that while it is theoretically possible to wholesale duplicate Wysc, please be aware that attributing our license is not enough should you wish to remain legal.

**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us](/docs/about/contact) to make it happen.

**If you have an idea to improve Wysc**, come join us in Contributor Hub! [See Contributor Hub for more details.](/docs/dev)

### Wysc on Discord

Wysc's server design, channel/category organization, and unique channel features are **open for others to replicate, as long as there is substantial remixing of features.**

We are always happy to see other servers incorporating our ideas! For example, we have pioneered a cafe experience through channels such as #studygram, automated mixed-use content feeds, and liberal use of colored embeds. All these features are available for the public to use as well! We encourage users to [check out our Credits page](/docs/about/credits) to see how we do it and create their own server using the very tools that have helped make our server possible.

However, **we do not tolerate a significantly replicated user experience** without prior arrangements or proper attribution. This includes (but is not limited to) copying many or all aspects of our server without a different target audience, using phrasing that is similar to our promotional material without noticeable variation, or providing an experience that may cause confusion between Wysc and your creation. Not only does this violate Wysc licenses, but depending on implementations, may also infringe on the licenses of content we use.
