### Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2 Apr 2020
- Letting users know that we collect logs and how we do it
- Bringing to attention how data may be stored by our data processors

### Identity & access

When you join Wysc Discord through a Discord invite, you agree to entering a public space where [all information Discord makes publicly available through their Developer documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) will be made available to all members of Wysc, including but not limited to: Wysc Staff, [third-party services we use](/docs/about/credits), and any malicious actors. We are not able to fully restrict attempts at data collection by outside users, and encourage you to read [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) to fully understand how your public data being collected may affect you.

Messages are retained for the lifetime of the service pursuant to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) in order to deliver the Wysc Discord service. You can delete your messages at any time through Discord.

Some or all of the data about you, whether made public by Discord or by messages you sent, may be recorded by Wysc for archival, diagnostic, moderation, operational, and statistical purposes. The information that Wysc collects will be retained for the lifetime of the service and made available to select groups of Wysc users.

Wysc may also share the collected data to third parties for the purposes of: investigating, preventing, or taking action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Content Policy](/docs/discord/content), or as otherwise required by law; or if Wysc is acquired by or merged with another entity.


### Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Most GDPR rights may be exercised through Discord. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [wyscofficial@icloud.com](/docs/about/contact) or refer to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy). We reserve the right to delay and batch-process your requests to exercise your rights should they become burdensome and/or laborious in nature to satisfy.


### Processors we use

As part of the services we provide, we may use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal information. These processors may maintain a log of your user data in order to serve features to Wysc and its users. This includes but is not limited to services such as: GitHub tracking contributors, music bots tracking users to process links, and utility bots logging your queries. All data collected solely consists of either publicly available data [as outlined in Discord's Developer documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) or data that you willingly make public. Wysc has limited to no control over this data collection, though Wysc may maintain access to the data in some instances.

For identification of processors we use, please see our [Credits page](/docs/about/credits). Our Credits page is a work in progress and may be missing some processors. [Contact us](/docs/about/contact) if you notice us using a processor that isn't listed here!


### Law enforcement

Wysc won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. Unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll attempt to contact you at your Discord account when such requests are made, should your Discord account remain a member of Wysc Discord.


### Security & Encryption

All Wysc Discord data is encrypted subject to [Discord's](https://discordapp.com/privacy) security practices when transmitted to your browser.

All Wysc Website data is encrypted subject to [Github](https://github.com/security) and [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/security/) security practices when transmitted to your browser.

We strive to use only services that offer [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to store and deliver content. If you discover a service we use that runs on an unencrypted connection, [please report it to us here](/docs/about/contact).


### Deleted data

When you delete your Discord account, any content related to your engagement with Wysc through Discord may remain accessible, though anonymized. [See Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) for more information on how data from deleted accounts are handled.

Even when you request for your data to be deleted from Wysc, please be aware that even when we delete as much data as we directly hold and control through our systems, your data may still reside with third party services we use [as listed on our Credits page](/docs/about/credits). For example, when you leave Wysc, your contributions are still logged by GitHub, and we are unable to remove your contributions from the git commit logs due to the fact that we do not control GitHub's servers.


### Location of Site and Data

This service is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to the United States. By using our service, participating in any of our services, and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.


### Changes & questions

Wysc may update this policy at any time in order to more accurately reflect the activities we engage in. We'll provide a courtesy notice regarding significant changes that may require action on your part by posting to our Blog and/or an announcement in Wysc Discord. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time either through Discord or by contacting [our support team](/docs/about/contact).

Questions about this privacy policy? Please [get in touch](/docs/about/contact) and we’ll be happy to answer them!
