piggybacking off of this, ebru, can wysc use the drawing as its logo? rn it's only being used as discord server icon  
"non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferrable, perpetual license to store, display, transmit, and modify Intellectual Property, worldwide"  
it's okay if you say no, since this does mean letting wysc use it for everything

Certainly you can use it as the logo, I'd be honoured :') I should make a cleaner one at some point then :'')))
