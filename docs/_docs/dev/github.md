### Getting Started

First, [log into your Github account](https://github.com/login) and go to [https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc](https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc).

Everything you edit will be in the `upstream` folder:
```
wysc/upstream/
```

Click `upstream` to go into the `upstream` folder.


### Understanding the Folders

Folders you need to know:
```
wysc/upstream/

_about          https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/
_bots           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/bots/
_dev            https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/dev/
_discord        https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/discord
```

Conveniently, they are all located at the top of the page!

Clicking into a folder, we see:
```
wysc/upstream/_about/

brand           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/brand/..
legal           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/..
org             https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/org/..
staff           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/staff/..
index.md        Wysc Docs - About main page
```

These are the subcategories you see here on [the About page](https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/).

### Category Structure

Here we finally get to the files themselves:
```
wysc/upstream/_about/legal/

1.md            https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/1
credits.md      https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/credits
privacy.md      https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/privacy
```

You may have noticed that the category sidebar doesn't sort files by their titles. That's because they're actually sorted by their filename!

Back in Github, let's click into a file and try to edit it.


### Viewing a File

Viewing the file is simple! After opening it, click `Raw` near the top right corner of the page.

### Editing a File

Editing a file is also easy! Click on the pencil icon near the top right corner of the page.

Github will automatically create a "fork" of Wysc. A "fork" is your own copy of Wysc saved under your Github account while you work on any changes you'd like.
