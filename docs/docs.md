### 1. Culture/Rules

**Respect the community, respect the space.** Nice and simple! For more, our community also moderates against certain content like advertising:

[See Culture/Rules](/docs/culture){: .jtbutton}

### 2. Ranking Up

Can't send images? Links getting deleted? Don't worry -- just chat and socialize, and you'll rank up from Seed to Sprout in minutes!

Wysc has a meritocratic rank system you may not be used to. See what perks ranking up can get you:

### 3. Wysc Library

The goal of our Pomodoro bot is to provide a sense of company while you are studying -- similar to being in a virtual library!

Students study independently along 1 of 4 customizable group Pomodoro timers. During break times, students can chat with each other, update their `#dailygoals`, and relax.

Voice calls, cameras, and screenshares are available (but never required), including `#studyspace`, `#studyradio`, and a private Pomodoro voice channel.

Read our full guide for bot commands:

- **#hangouts** - Play games and join [Group Events](/docs/events)!
- **#cafe-center** - Send memes, chat about games, and more (off-topic channel)
