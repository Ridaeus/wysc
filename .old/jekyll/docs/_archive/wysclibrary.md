## Study Partners

The #study-partners channel was created to help students find others who may be studying the same subject or field as them, and can reach out to each other to form a study group.

To participate in the channel, simply fill out the provided template and send the message in [#study-partners](https://discordapp.com/channels/319372945929666571/611700766737956874/). All fields are optional; you are only obligated to fill out anything you feel comfortable sharing.

##### Template

```

**Name:** 
**Country/Region:** 
**Current Education Level:** 

**Looking for in a study partner:** 
**Interests/Major:** 
**Current Coursework:** 

**Describe Yourself:** 
```

##### Fields

All fields below are guidelines for how to use the fields. We do not recommend posting any personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to find others relevant to your interest. However, as long as the introduction does not [breach common Wysc culture](culture), the post will remain.

###### Name

Fill out any name you would like to be referred to as by others. This can be your Discord name, real name, nickname, or anything else you like.

###### Country/Region

This field is intended to help others determine the education structure you are most familiar with. For example, USA students may not be aware of the difference between "college" and "university" commonly used in the UK. This field can also be used to organize around timezones.

The suggested use for this field is to refer to your country if it only has one timezone or a specific region of your country if it has more than one (ie. "USA West Coast" or "California, United States").

We do not recommend mentioning cities unless they are highly populated (ie. "New York City" or "Singapore") in order to maintain sufficient anonymity.

###### Current Education Level

Fill out your current education status. Some examples may include "high school", "university", "undergraduate", and "homeschooled".

###### Looking for in a study partner

Fill out what you are seeking to gain from a study partner. Some examples may include "study buddy on Calculus", "SAT practice", "someone in my major", and "NO POMEGRANATES".

###### Interests/Major

Fill out your interests, major, or anything you may be looking to do with a study partner. Some examples may include "Computer Science", "Pre-med", "studying for MCAT", and "playing Minecraft".

###### Current Coursework

Fill out some of the coursework you are planning to take or are currently taking that relates to your study partner request. This field is intended to help others determine what level of courses you are taking for a more well-matched study partner.

###### Describe Yourself

This is a multipurpose field intended for you to introduce yourself, describe your situation, and appeal to others. Feel free to comment anything you'd like! (within [common Wysc culture](culture) guidelines)

## Resources

Share scholarships, interesting educational facts, upcoming important test dates, and more in #resources! This resources channel is a shared asset for all students to peruse in order to elevate everyone's educational level.

## Reflections

Reflecting on your soul is a healthy habit, and helps the mind flow free. Write whatever you like (preferably sfw) to the world! By posting your mission and tasks to other studious users, you are [creating accountability that helps motivate you to succeed](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-accountability-effect-a-simple-way-to-achieve-your-goals-and-boost-your-performance-8a07c76ef53a). This helps keep you motivated to keep going!

A monthly goal helps form a timeline and organize your life, allowing increased dedication to the task. Accountability includes putting down steps to complete that goal, and other assignments you have due along the way that you have to complete.

Throughout the session, you can continuously go back to your post and edit it, as well as reflect on your progress on how you did. To encourage a more spiritual mood, feel free to also reply to other users' Reflections as well!

##### Reflections Example:
