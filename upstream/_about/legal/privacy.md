### Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 17 Jan 2020

### Identity & access

When you sign up for Wysc, you agree to entering a public space where [all information Discord makes publicly available through their Developer documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) will be made available to all members of Wysc, including but not limited to: Wysc Staff, [third-party services](credits), and malicious actors. We are not able to fully restrict attempts at data collection by outside users, and encourage you to read [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) to fully understand how this public access to your data may affect you.

When you use Wysc Docs, there may be an option for you to toggle Light Mode. Toggling Light Mode places a cookie in your browser that allows us to remember your theme choice. This information is not collected or personally identifiable, and happens locally.

The only times we’ll ever actively share your info is:

- To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.
- To process information that will generate statistics.
- To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Content Policy](../../discord/content/1), or as otherwise required by law.
- If Wysc is acquired by or merged with another entity (we don’t plan on that, but if it happens)


### Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Most GDPR rights may be exercised through Wysc Discord. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [wyscofficial@icloud.com](../org/contact). We reserve the right to batch-process your requests to exercise your rights should they become burdensome and/or laborious in nature to satisfy.


### Processors we use

As part of the services we provide, we may use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal information. For identification of processors, please see our [Credits page](credits). Our Credits page is a work in progress and may be missing some processors. [Contact us](../org/contact) if you notice us using a processor that isn't listed here!


### Law enforcement

Wysc won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. Unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll attempt to contact you at your Discord account when such requests are made, should your Discord account remain a member of Wysc Discord.


### Security & Encryption

All Wysc Discord data is encrypted subject to [Discord's](https://discordapp.com/privacy) security practices when transmitted to your browser.

All Wysc Website data is encrypted subject to [Github](https://github.com/security) and [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/security/) security practices when transmitted to your browser.

We strive to use only services that offer [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to store and deliver content. If you discover a service we use that runs on an unencrypted connection, [please report it to us here](../org/contact).


### Deleted data

When you delete your Discord account, any content related to your engagement with Wysc through Discord may remain accessible, though anonymized. [See Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) for more information on how data from deleted accounts are handled.


### Location of Site and Data

This Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.


### Changes & questions

Wysc may update this policy at any time in order to more accurately reflect the activities we engage in. We'll provide a courtesy notice regarding significant changes that may require action on your part by posting to our Blog and/or an announcement in Wysc Discord. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time either through Discord or by contacting [our support team](../org/contact).
