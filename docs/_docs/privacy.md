### Privacy Policy

Last updated: 22 May 2020
- Clarifying language around the kind of user data we collect


### Identity & access

Wysc does not sell data about you.

Wysc may retain information about Wysc Discord users in other public spaces Wysc operates, including GitHub.

When you join Wysc Discord with a Discord account, you agree to entering a public space where your public user data may be logged by Wysc, Discord, [third-party services we use](/docs/credits), and all other users.

All messages sent by an end user is considered public user data due to the public nature of Wysc Discord. Messages sent in Wysc Discord are stored, processed, and distributed by Discord pursuant to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Wysc reserves the right, but not the obligation, to remove messages from public spaces it operates at its sole discretion. Wysc most commonly exercises this right for: moderation purposes; and to remove personally identifiable information that is posted by users in a public space and brought to our attention.

Wysc logs certain public user data such as (but not limited to): your username, avatar, user ID, account creation timestamp, arrival/departure timestamps, and edited/deleted messages. Wysc uses these logs for channel usage and moderation purposes. Logs for edited/deleted messages are removed after 10 days using an automated process, but we cannot guarantee its uptime. Wysc stores other logs for the lifetime of the service.


### Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

GDPR and CCPA give people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us.

Wysc does not collect personal information. However, you may have provided personal information to some or all of the [third-party services we use](/docs/credits), including Discord and GitHub.

### Processors we use

As part of the services we provide, we may use [third-party processors](/docs/credits) to process some or all of your public information. We use third-party processors: to operate services provided by Wysc Discord; for moderation purposes; and to process and use usage data to improve Wysc services. All data collected solely consists of either publicly available data [available in Discord's Developer documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or data that you have made public by interacting in Wysc Discord. Wysc has limited to no control over this data collection, though Wysc may maintain access to the data in some instances.

These processors may store logs of your public user data in order to serve features to Wysc and its users. This includes but is not limited to services such as: GitHub tracking contributors, music bots tracking users to process links, and moderation bots logging arrivals and departures from Wysc Discord.

Wysc may share data we have collected to third parties outside of the third-party processors above for the purposes of: investigating, preventing, or taking action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Content Policy](/docs/culture), or as otherwise required by law; or if Wysc is acquired by or merged with another entity.

Our Credits page is a work in progress and may be missing some processors. [Contact us](/docs/contact) if you notice us using a processor that isn't listed here!


### Law enforcement

Wysc won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. Unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll attempt to contact you at your Discord account when such requests are made, should your Discord account remain a member of Wysc Discord.


### Security & Encryption

All Wysc Discord data is encrypted in transit subject to [Discord's](https://discordapp.com/privacy){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} security practices.

All Wysc Website data is encrypted in transit subject to [Github](https://github.com/security){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/security/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} security practices.

We strive to use only services that offer [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to deliver content. If you discover a service we use that runs on an unencrypted connection, [please report it to us here](/docs/contact).


### Deleted data

Wysc does not collect personal information. However, you may have provided personal information to some or all of the [third-party services we use](/docs/credits), including Discord and GitHub.

When you delete your Discord account, any content related to your engagement with Wysc Discord may remain accessible, though anonymized. [See Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for more information on how data from deleted accounts are handled.

Even when you request for your data to be deleted, please be aware your data may still reside with Wysc, [third party services we use](/docs/credits), and other users due to the public nature of interacting with Wysc. For example, users may take screenshots of conversations; contributions to Wysc GitHub are logged in its Git history for the lifetime of the Git history; and anonymized data may remain since it can't be identified for deletion.


### Location of Site and Data

This service is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to the United States. By participating in our services and/or processes, you consent to this transfer.
