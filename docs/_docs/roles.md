### Ranking Up

Wysc's rank system is meritocratic. The more you chat, the more permissions you can get! Our rank system is named after an ecosystem environment, with a sliding scale of Seeds to Trees.

The rank hierarchy is as follows:

| Activity-based (automatic) | Contributor Hub (eligibility / *invitation only*) |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Seed](#seed) | \- |
| [Sprout](#sprout) | *Droplet* |
| [Sapling](#sapling) | Droplet, *Pond* |
| [Treeling](#treeling) | Droplet, *Pond*, *Lake* |
| [Tree](#tree) | Droplet, *Pond*, *Lake*, *Ecosystem Supporter* |
