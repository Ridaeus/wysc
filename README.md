All users are welcome to contribute any code revisions they deem appropriate through a pull request. Wysc Staff will review the pull requests and, if approved, will also qualify your username to be listed [on our Contributors page](https://wysc.netlify.com/contributors).

 

### Credits:

We do not believe in theft of other works. Using our open source code to contribute to your own works is okay, but wholesale theft for personal profit crosses a line at Wysc. As a result, we'd like to be friendly patrons of the open source community as well and \(attempt to\) list all resources we have come to rely on [in our credits page](https://gitnisyl.github.io/wysc/docs/about/credits). Are we missing something? [Let us know and we'll be glad to add you on our list!](https://gitnisyl.github.io/wysc/docs/about/contact#official-inquiries)
