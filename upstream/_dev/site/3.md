### Category Structure

Here we finally get to the files themselves:
```
wysc/upstream/_about/legal/

1.md            https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/1
credits.md      https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/credits
privacy.md      https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/privacy
```

You may have noticed that the category sidebar doesn't sort files by their titles. That's because they're actually sorted by their filename!

![Screenshot of category sidebar, the page titles of 1.md, credits.md, and privacy.md respectively show as Licenses, Credits, and Privacy Policy](/media/docs/Annotation 2020-01-19 001721.jpg)

Back in Github, let's click into a file and try to edit it.


### Viewing a File

Viewing the file is simple! After opening it, click `Raw` near the top right corner of the page.

### Editing a File

Editing a file is also easy! Click on the pencil icon near the top right corner of the page.

Github will automatically create a "fork" of Wysc. A "fork" is your own copy of Wysc saved under your Github account while you work on any changes you'd like.


### Front Matter

At the top of every file, there's a section that's boxed in.
```
---
layout: kbdocs
title:  "Licenses"
category: "Legal"
last_updated: 17 Jan 2020
summary: "Wysc's stance on licensing of its property ranges from open to restricted based on your use case. Explore your options below."

```

This is called "front matter". It lets you change information that influences how the page is shown. Let's break down the ones you need to know:
```
---
title:          The name of the page
last_updated:   Date of last major update to the page
summary:        Optional. Shows both in the page and in the Discord link embed.
redirect_from:  Other links you can reach the page from
---
```


### Content

Finally we're at the actual content of the webpage!

From here on, everything's standard based on Markdown. [Here's a basic introduction to Markdown from Github!](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Wysc Docs has some quirks though:
- All headings should be `###`, aka. Heading 3
- Blockquotes and numbered lists don't work. Mayo has been lazy so it's not supported in Wysc Docs yet.
- Sometimes images don't show up right. Mayo will fix this eventually...
