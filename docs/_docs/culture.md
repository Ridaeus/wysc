<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl">Respect the community, respect the space.</p>

Pretty easy, right?


* TOC
{:toc}


### What are we like?

Think of us like a neighborhood coffee shop. It's a nice, comfy place on your way to work. It's okay to hold controversial opinions.

It can make others uncomfortable though when one starts posting uncomfortable material, speaking in an uncomfortable way, or pushing their views onto others.

So, please consider a business-casual level of maturity when interacting with Wysc, and to keep the environment in mind before speaking your thoughts! We'd like to keep Wysc a relaxed, friendly place :)


<div id="what-do-we-really-hate"></div>

### What's not okay?

There are things that don't belong in any server, including at Wysc.

**Do not try any of the following, or we will take action against your account:**
- Excessive drug related messages and paraphernalia
- Excessive violence
- Porn/Inappropriate material (including in your username/profile)
- Spam and Unsolicited DMs (including sending unwanted DMs to Wysc members)
- Asking for homework/exam answers
- Breaking Discord Terms of Service (including joining Wysc while being under 13 years old)

This is obviously not an exhaustive list. Do not test Wysc's limit. We are here to chill and study, not be mischievous.


### Ranking Up in Wysc

In order to encourage good faith within the Wysc community, we allow some potentially sensitive behavior only after ranking up in Wysc so that we get to know each other better!

- [Advertising](#advertising)
- [Data Collection (including surveys)](#data-collection)


#### Advertising

Advertising is defined as any activity that aims to encourage an external user to engage with a product or service you (1) own, (2) are affiliated with, or (3) derive some benefit from.

If you have content that falls under advertising but is relevant to a conversation, you can share it under `#bots-spam`.

- **Seed users**  
  All Seed users are **prohibited from engaging in any advertising behavior, with any Wysc user, on any Wysc property**. Our community members are here because they are dedicated to their studies, and have not consented to be advertised to. In addition, we do not believe new members are well acquainted enough with our community to advertise in Wysc.

- **Sprout users**  
  All Sprout users can engage server-wide **only when relevant by conversation**. All Wysc members reserve rights to delete if anyone is uncomfortable.

- **Sapling and above users**  
  All Sapling and above users are allowed to engage in advertising behavior, serverwide, within reason.


#### Data Collection

**Do not join Wysc solely to collect data for a project, product, service, or any other topic.** While Wysc appreciates your consideration, we ask that you respect our members' time, attention, and communal environment by only requesting data collection after you have become a member in good faith.

This includes all surveys (educational or otherwise) and GoFundMe/donation requests.

- **Seed users**  
  All Seed users are **forbidden** from engaging in **any** data collection behavior.  

- **Sprout users**  
  All Sprout users must meet [GDPR compliance](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with all data collection, to certify that you will treat Wysc members' time and data responsibly. This means clearly listing the following:
    - What you will need the data for
    - How you will be collecting the data (Google Forms? A bot?)
    - How you will process the data (Python? Google Docs?)
    - How long you will keep the data (maximum 3 months)  
    
  You also acknowledge that you will:
  {:.mb-0}
    - Only make **one** post in **#human-social** about your data collection request, along with all of the above data
    - Wysc members can request editing or deletion of their responses at any time
    - Send final (anonymous/aggregate) results to Wysc
    {:.pb-6}

- **Sapling and above users**  
  All Sapling and above users are free to engage in data collection (including asking for survey respondents) within reason.
  
  Other types of mass data collection may require special arrangements with Wysc Staff, who are reachable in `#support`.
