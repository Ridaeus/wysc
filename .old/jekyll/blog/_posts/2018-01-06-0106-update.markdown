Just another flyer on the announcement board:

**<@360069875504513035>#7514 Now Banned - Read on if you got a DM from her**

Jennifer has messaged a small portion of our users requesting for help writing an essay for her. Because we take incidences of mass DM'ing users seriously, as well as the implications that can arise from assisting with plagiarism, we have taken actions to notify Jennifer of her infractions and have thus banned her from WSC.

We apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused, and would like to take the chance and remind everyone to keep this option off for increased privacy and security!
