Wysc respects individual freedoms. When we partner with third parties in an official capacity to grow the Wysc experience, we acknowledge and respect your creations. What we look for is simple: a legal right to integrate your creation into the Wysc experience -- not to monopolize your creation!

[See our Intellectual Property License Agreement here](files/wyscpartner)

Here's a human-readable summary of what we look for (that is not legally binding):
- Everything is free. No royalties, no payments.
  - You get to control what you do with your property, Wysc is only asking to be able to use it
  - If Wysc rebrands itself or creates a subsidiary, Wysc can keep this agreement going
  - The agreement lasts until one of us requests to cancel it
  - Wysc can modify your property to integrate it as necessary, feature it as a part of the Wysc experience, and distribute it to the public
- Ending the Contract
  - Authorship credit: All of us retain rights to use the property or any derivations in personal portfolios, even after the contract ends
  - Advance notice of 6 months must be given before the agreement is cancelled
  - Wysc then has up to 6 months after the agreement cancels to remove your property from active use (ie. removing a server icon)
  - Wysc may still have copies of your property, but only for archival purposes, such as in old Discord messages (ie. someone uses a bot command to retrieve the server icon picture)
- Technicalities
  - Your property might cause damage to us. We swear we won't hold you liable for any damages.
  - We negotiate over any disagreements, no arbitration.
  - You sign by sending your Discord User ID via a Discord message while explicitly conveying approval of this agreement.
