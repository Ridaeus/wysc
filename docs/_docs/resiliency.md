**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us](/docs/about/contact) to make it happen. Copying our server behind our backs would not only show off how immature and desperate you are, but also mean more work for you trying to reverse-engineer our features.

For more information about what you're allowed to copy from Wysc, see our [Licenses](licenses) page.


### Channels and Purpose

The easiest part of Wysc to copy is the channels we have. We aren't shy about our channels -- after all, most of the ideas for the channel names and purposes have come from our need of serving our community. Wysc's server setup behind the scenes, however, is substantially more complex and involves many features that work in tandem.

**We believe that the way members, roles, and channel permissions interact with each other in Wysc is a distinct part of the Wysc experience, that this experience is difficult to replicate without assistance, and that any attempt to fraudulently replicate Wysc without proper implementation of this experience would be inferior.**

Our implementation of user experience enhancing features may appear easy to implement on the surface, but each refinement has been a result of live user feedback and improvements, which we are confident would outperform an imitation craft.


### Automation

The Wysc experience is vastly complemented by automation, including but not limited to: group study, music feeds, and branded announcements. We do not use solely Discord bots to provide the Wysc experience. (For example, this website you're seeing runs on automated services!)

**We believe that the services automation help provide are a distinct part of the Wysc experience, that they are difficult to replicate without assistance, and that any attempt to fraudulently replicate Wysc without these features would be inferior.**

In addition, we have also invested significantly in personalizing many of the automated services we use, which means replicating Wysc to a satisfactory degree without assistance would take substantial effort and knowledge about the services we use.



### Administrative Model

The Wysc experience is defined by its community-oriented service model. When compared to a top-down moderation system, our model cultivates a strong, dedicated community that advocates for its own needs and moderates to the degree that they are comfortable with.

**We believe that this is a fundamentally different mindset than the average Discord server available, that this experience is difficult to replicate without assistance, and would be prohibitive without such an experience for any fraudulent replicant of Wysc.**
