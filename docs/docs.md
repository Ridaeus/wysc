### 1. How does Wysc work?

As a new user, there are many restrictions like no sending links. Don't worry! As you chat more, these restrictions disappear.

**Respect the community, respect the space.** This is the core of Wysc's philosophy. We are a place for relaxing and studying together.

Wysc users start at Seed rank. The ranks go Seed, Sprout, Sapling, Treeling, and Tree.

[See Culture/Rules](/docs/culture){: .jtbutton}
[See Roles](/docs/roles){: .jtbutton}


### 2. What are the channels?

Wysc is separated into 3 sections:
- **Social ðŸ¥‚**  
Freely chat and socialize! **`#hangouts`** is for organizing games and other group events with friends.  

- **Wysc Library ðŸ“š**  
Study with us! We study together in **`#study-groups`** (more info below).  

- **Wysc Cafe â˜•**  
Have fun here! Share memes and videos in **`#cafe-center`**, as well as in other channels.

[See Group Events](/docs/events){: .jtbutton}


### 3. How do I study in Wysc?

Our goal is to provide a sense of company while you are studying -- similar to being in a virtual library!

Students study independently along 1 of 4 customizable group Pomodoro timers in **`#study-groups`**. These timers also come with private voice channels.

Voice calls, cameras, and screenshares are also available in **`#studyspace`** and **`#studyradio`**, but we encourage you to start in **`#study-groups`** first!

[See Group Study](/docs/study){: .jtbutton}

Wysc is a community. If you ever have any questions or concerns, you can always reach us in our Discord's **`#support`** channel!
