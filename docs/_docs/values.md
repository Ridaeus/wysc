- **Sustainable**
- **Reliable**
- **User-Driven**


By sustainable, we should be looking for ways to improve the experience for all in a way we can guarantee provision for, long-term. For example, Wysc Docs is open-source, Wysc leadership is communally organized, and bots used are public instances -- so that even if admins disappear, the Wysc spirit can continue to live on.

By reliable, we should be constantly looking towards stability. We want to be predictable and stable in our service offerings. We offer a suite of study and social features for an online community, so we shouldn't be abandoning our server to start a lemonade business, or to sell out to someone else. We want to be here for you when you look for Wysc the study server, and still be around after you graduate. We want to still be here when you reminisce about your time with us, years into the future.

By user-driven, we should constantly uplift our community's ability to push the envelope. Wysc was founded by two individuals, but that doesn't mean Wysc has to be run by two individuals. The community has helped make Wysc what it is today, and should have an equal right to contribute changes, features, and pursue moderation in line with the Wysc philosophy. There shouldn't be a king at the top, Wysc is us, not me.

We learn valuable lessons every time we cross one of these lines. To betray these values means to betray Wysc and its community as a whole, and we will fully commit ourselves to sticking with these principles so that we can rightfully earn your faith in us.
