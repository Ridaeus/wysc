### Using Wysc Resources

Wysc believes in transparency of how we operate and to provide an open experience for our community members. However, Wysc takes intellectual property seriously.

**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us](/docs/contact) to make it happen.
