<p style="font-family:'Cookie';font-size:2em;">For students striving to be better, Wysc is the study Discord server that delivers a cohesive, global online studying experience, as the first Discord server to present an edu-social cafe experience to an audience of hundreds.</p>

This tagline defines who we are and everything we do as Wysc.

In [June 2019](/blog/2019/june-2019-wysc-server-revamp), we embarked on a new mission to change the way students can approach studying online. When we first entered the study Discord scene in 2017, what we saw was a collection of passionate students looking for a place to study together. There were servers for homework help and specialized Discords tailored to exams and university admissions were slowly becoming popular as well. However, their approach was providing the best services possible in their niche and employing moderators to enforce discussions. Make no mistake, these Discords were effective at serving the student population, but they were also oftentimes high-energy and strived for continuous growth.

Wysc is different. We're looking to create a home. We're the small coffee shop you always walk by on the way to school. We're the place you come in afterschool to read a nice book in, to share a life event with others in, and just to chill and hang out. We're a virtual study cafe.

While we do have studious and hardworking students grinding away in our study lounges, we're here first and foremost to help you cultivate a sense of community. We're not afraid of sacrificing server member count for a quality, close-knit experience with your fellow study mates.

In these tumultuous times, an open server such as ours [can be a dangerous thing](/blog/2019/misbehaving-users.html). But we're not afraid to stand our ground. Our rank system is meritocratic and community-led. As you rank up, you gain more permissions and more freedoms, culminating in the ability to help decide the future of Wysc for yourself in a community forum. [Accordingly, Wysc's Github is also open source, including this website!](/docs/about/licenses)


### Wysc Values

The life of a Discord server often ebbs and flows. However, we want to commit to these values no matter where we decide to forge ahead.

<br>

#### Sustainable

We're not only looking in the short term, but constantly exploring what impacts we effect now may have months down the line.

- When we invite third party bots into the server, we're crediting them on our website and respecting them for the services they help make possible
- When partnering, we'd like to explore deeper integrations that go beyond a mutual server advertisement
- When expanding our server, we're looking for ways our community can take the lead and maintain a friendly environment

<br>

#### Reliable

We want to approach the way we provide services ethically and responsibly.

- Our moderation and community standards should be consistent and non-discriminatory
- Our services should be geared for long-term support, allowing a member who left five years ago to find and join the server again today
- Our server should never abandon its members, for example by selling out to a for-profit entity

<br>

#### User-Driven

The primary driver of activity on the server should be the community itself.

- Wysc's goal should never be to own a server, it's to be a platform that hosts a warm, productive home for learners
- Wysc channels should be moderated by active members of the community rather than by draconian moderation policies
- Wysc should be as open as possible to all active users that call Wysc home
