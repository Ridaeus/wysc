Advertising is defined as any activity that aims to encourage an external user to engage with a product or service you (1) own, (2) are affiliated with, or (3) derive some benefit from. Advertising is a restricted category on Wysc. [Rules and Culture](/docs/discord/culture) still apply.

### Seed users

All Seed users are **prohibited from engaging in any advertising behavior**. We do not believe new members are well acquainted enough with our community to advertise in Wysc. If you have content that falls under advertising but is relevant to a conversation, you may share it under `#bots-spam`, though Wysc members reserve deletion rights and right to enact administrative action.

### Sprout users

All Sprout users are allowed to engage in advertising behavior within reason in relevant channels, **except for #lounge**. All advertising must be accompanied by relevant conversation. Wysc members reserve deletion rights and right to enact administrative action.

### Sapling and above users

All Sapling and above users are allowed to engage in advertising behavior, serverwide, within reason.

### Questions?

Your messages may be deleted and your account may be subject to administrative action should they violate the policies above. Reach out to us in #support with any questions!
