Advertising is a restricted category on Wysc. General [Content Policy](1) regulations still apply.

### Seed users

All Seed users may post their own content in Wysc Cafe channels within channel guidelines, within reasonable rate limits.

All Seed users are **forbidden** from engaging in any promotional behavior with other Wysc users **in all other circumstances**.

This includes, but is not limited to: promoting servers, social media accounts, music profiles, and other affiliated services outside of their respective Wysc Cafe channels, if relevant; direct messaging Wysc users; and collecting data regarding users made available through Wysc, public or otherwise.

All Sprout users are permitted to engage in promotional behavior within channel guidelines, **with the exception of #lounge**, within reasonable rate limits.

For example, within reasonable rate limits, an owner of a studyblr account may promote their blog in #study-center; an owner of a meme account may promote their social media in #wysc-irl; and an owner of a bujo store may promote their shop in #reflections.
