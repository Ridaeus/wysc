Wysc relies on contributors like you to help expand documentation for Wysc!

To get started, you need the following:

- [A GitHub account (free)](https://github.com/)
- [A web browser (free)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)


### Introduction

**What these words mean:**
- Repo/Repository
    - A git repository, or "repo", is the home of a project.
    - Git is a technology that lets developers keep track of changes to their project easily, and GitHub makes Git nice and easy to use.
- Fork a project
    - You can't directly make changes to someone else's repo. What you do is make a copy of, or "fork", the repo and then start making changes in your personal copy.
- Commit changes
    - Every time you make a change to a file, "Commit changes" is your save button.
    - When you're done making all the changes you want, you'll now have a list of "commits" that show what changes you've made and to which file.
- Pull request
    - When you're done making all the changes you want to your own copy, you want your changes to go back to the main repo/project.
    - To do that, you start a "pull request", which lets the other person know you made changes!
    - You set the options to point from your repo to the main repo, write a short explanation for what you changed, then click Submit
    - When your pull request is approved, your changes will now show up in their code!
- Markdown
    - Markdown is a type of text file that is easy to edit. [See here for a guide on how to use Markdown!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

    - There are three folders for each section of the Wysc Docs:

        - `discord` - Wysc Discord
        - `dev` - Contributor Hub
- All assets (files, images, videos, etc.) should be stored under the `assets` folder
- All documentation headings should use Heading 3 (`### Heading 3`) or Heading 4 (`#### Heading 4`)
