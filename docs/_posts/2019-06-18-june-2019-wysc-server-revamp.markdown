As students across the world arrive at a lull in their studies, Wysc is proud to begin a series of renovations to the server that fundamentally change <!--more-->how we seek to operate from today forth.

For one, we are no longer named 'Work・Studying・Chilling', more colloquially referred to as 'WSC'. From late June 2019 onwards, we will be rebranding as 'Wysc'. This decision was taken as a step forward to develop a stronger brand name for the service we provide, while still maintaining a sense of familiarity for our existing community.

All aspects of Wysc are currently undergoing a thorough revamp, from the server experience to the companion website. A new simplified permissions system is under development, as well as a new feed-powered experience across Wysc. This will mean more evergreen content on a more sustainable trajectory.

Wysc's goal is to provide a laid-back environment free of overbearing constraints for patrons to interact at their own discretion. To that end, we're in this with you for the long haul, and we're committed to delivering a satisfactory service in a way that is scalable and reliable.

New server and website features will be rolled out incrementally throughout June 2019 and into the summer as they become ready. We hope you're as excited as we are!

Thank you,
