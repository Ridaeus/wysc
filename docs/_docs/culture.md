Pretty easy, right?

### What are we like?

Think of us like a neighborhood coffee shop. It's a nice, comfy place on your way to work. It's okay to hold controversial opinions.

It can make others uncomfortable though when one starts posting uncomfortable material, speaking in an uncomfortable way, or pushing their views onto others.

So, please consider a business-casual level of maturity when interacting with Wysc, and to keep the environment in mind before speaking your thoughts! We'd like to keep Wysc a relaxed, friendly place :)

### What's not okay?

There are things that don't belong in any server, including at Wysc.

**Do not try any of the following, or we will take action against your account:**
- Excessive drug related messages and paraphernalia
- Excessive violence
- Explicit material (including porn)
- Spam and Unsolicited DMs (including sending unwanted DMs to Wysc members)
- Breaking Discord Terms of Service (including joining Wysc while being under 13 years old)

This is obviously not an exhaustive list. Do not test Wysc's limit. We are here to chill and study, not be mischievous.
