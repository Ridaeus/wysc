Wysc's culture is one we strive to maintain and nurture. While we don't have a laundry list of rules, our administrative policy towards user behavior is simple and direct.

<p class="p-4" style="font-size:36px">Don't be a dick.</p>

This applies to the broadest extent. And lean on the safe side just to be sure. **We aren't doing this to be a snowflake server. We just want to study and chill.** [See our Prohibited Activities](#what-do-we-really-hate) for specific activities we'll take strong action against.

### What's our Culture like?

Think of us like a neighborhood coffee shop. You'll probably go there to catch up with some friends, sip a latte, or grab a donut. It's a generally nice atmosphere overall, and usually it's not criminal to have *insert controversial opinion*. But when someone comes in and starts exerting themselves, whether by blatantly shouting out their point, spamming a conversation topic, or joining to push an agenda, it makes the environment uncomfortable. We're like that. 

Over time, Wysc has grown to be a relatively small, comfy, and peaceful study server. Despite our constantly growing size, our members consistently report a small-server feel, where everyone feels welcome and free. It's certainly jarring (both for us and for the new user) when new users join without being aware of how we're different, so we ask that you take caution at how your actions may be interpreted.

### How are we run?

Wysc operates in a cooperative model, where the older members of our community gain the tools to be able to maintain the friendly environment they have grown up in. As such, Wysc Staff will not be the only users who can take action against malicious users. However, if you are quarantined, you will have a chance to appeal the decision to Wysc Staff.

### What do we really hate?

Hate's a strong word. There really isn't a lot we require from you as a user, but here are specific things Wysc takes very seriously:

- [Advertising](ads)
- [Data Collection (including surveys)](data)
- Requesting help from others disrespectfully
  - Especially when you're a new user and/or doing it repeatedly
  - Wysc is **not** a tutoring server. Do not demand help for your homework.
- DM'ing users without permission beforehand
- Excessive drug related messages and paraphernalia
- Explicit material (including porn)

<br>

This isn't an exhaustive list, and it shouldn't be. We shouldn't need to list out what is and isn't required of you to be a member of a community. Common sense and common decency should be the norm.

Just be nice to everyone, and everything will work out! ðŸŒ¸
