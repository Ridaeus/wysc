### Getting Started

First, [log into your Github account](https://github.com/login) and go to [https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc](https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc).

Everything you edit will be in the `upstream` folder:
```
wysc/upstream/
```

Click `upstream` to go into the `upstream` folder.


### Understanding the Folders

Folders you need to know:
```
wysc/upstream/

_about          https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/
_bots           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/bots/
_dev            https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/dev/
_discord        https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/discord
```

Conveniently, they are all located at the top of the page!

Clicking into a folder, we see:
```
wysc/upstream/_about/

brand           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/brand/..
legal           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/legal/..
org             https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/org/..
staff           https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/staff/..
index.md        Wysc Docs - About main page
```

These are the subcategories you see here on [the About page](https://wysc.netlify.com/docs/about/).

Let's keep going deeper.
