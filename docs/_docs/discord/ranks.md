Wysc's rank system is meritocratic. The more you chat, the more permissions you can get! Our rank system is named after an ecosystem environment, with a sliding scale of Seeds to Trees.

The rank hierarchy is as follows:

| Activity-based (mandatory) | Contributor Hub (optional, eligibility) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Seed | |
| Sprout | Droplet (invitation only) |
| Sapling | Droplet, Pond |
| Treeling | Droplet, Pond, Lake |
| Tree | Droplet, Pond, Lake, Ecosystem Supporter |
