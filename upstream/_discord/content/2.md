There isn't a lot we require from you as a user, but here are some specific behaviors Wysc will take strong action against:

<br>

- [Advertising](ads)
- [Data Collection (including surveys)](data)
- Requesting help from others disrespectfully
  - Especially when you're a new user and/or doing it repeatedly
  - Wysc is **not** a tutoring server. Do not demand help for your homework.
- DM'ing users without permission beforehand
- Excessive drug related messages and paraphernalia
- Explicit material (including porn)

<br>

This isn't an exhaustive list, and it shouldn't be. We shouldn't need to list out what is and isn't required of you to be a member of a community. Common sense and common decency should be the norm.

Just be nice to everyone, and everything will work out! ðŸŒ¸
