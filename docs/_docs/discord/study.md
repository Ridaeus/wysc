Group Study is one of Wysc's primary features.

Uniting students from across borders, timezones, and subjects, Wysc's Group Study services help create a warm, comfortable environment for everyone to study together.

### What is Pomodoro?

What is Pomodoro? It's a popular study technique where you study and take breaks in a designated cycle, most traditionally in 25-minute studying, 5-minute resting increments (stylized as 25/5).

Wysc integrates [PomoBot](https://github.com/Intery/PomoBot) to provide group study functionality for our members. Hosting is generously provided by [Puerøsøla](/docs/about/credits#PomoBot).

In Wysc, students can join one of three study groups at any time.
