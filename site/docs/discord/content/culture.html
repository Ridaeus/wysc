<p>All of Wysc follows a four-word mantra:</p>

<p style="font-size:36px">Don't be a dick.</p>

<p>You don’t have to like everyone in the server. You don’t have to be active in the server. You don’t have to participate in the server.</p>

<p>You can promote and advertise anything you’d like, within reasonable limits that don’t impede on other’s abilities to interact with the server.</p>

<p>You can enjoy a heated argument in <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/319372945929666571/477015747256778755/">#bots-spam</a> or in direct messages should it come to that situation.</p>

<p>However, if you only join to troll, or to promote your product then leave, or to cause a hassle for others, that’s breaching Wysc culture. If you’re harassing others, discriminating against other users, or otherwise impeding others’ ability to enjoy Wysc as what Wysc has to offer, you’re breaching Wysc culture. “It’s just a prank bro” is not an excuse.</p>

<p>Wysc has no specific rules. We strive to be an open platform that hosts free exchange of information and interaction between students. However, there is still a limit well mentioned by philosopher Karl Popper: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">“Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.”</a></p>

<h2 id="exemptions">Exemptions</h2>

<p>While Wysc Staff do not actively attempt to suppress conversations in Wysc, Wysc Staff reserve full rights to add, modify, delete, or otherwise regulate the conversation flow at any time.</p>

<p>While Wysc Staff do not actively attempt to suppress conversations in Wysc, please be aware that <a href="server-ranks#tree">users of Tree rank</a> always have the ability to delete messages and quarantine users for any reason they deem is disruptive of common server activity. They do not hold rights to kick or ban users and you will have the opportunity to explain your case to Wysc Staff.</p>

<p>Wysc Staff also do not actively enforce safe-for-work only discussions, but do strongly encourage members keep in mind how their messages may affect minors. Wysc Staff and/or <a href="server-ranks#tree">users of Tree rank</a> may actively enforce a quarantine for users who excessively engage in nsfw behavior at any time they deem necessary.</p>

<p>Because this server is community-run, we believe that as high ranking members of the server, Trees are able to moderate the server they have come to be extremely active in, with their past experience. This meritocratic system allows all users to have a chance to be a part of Wysc in the truest sense!</p>

<h2 id="server-security">Server Security</h2>

<p>While Wysc Staff do not actively attempt to suppress conversations in Wysc, please be aware that we have <a href="server-security">some automated processes in place</a> that are intended to disrupt common actions performed by malicious users. The <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/319372945929666571/477015747256778755/">#bots-spam</a> channel is open to most users for unrestricted discussion in such case.</p>
